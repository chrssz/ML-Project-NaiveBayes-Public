# naivebayes
Machine learning algorithim
Developed a machine learning algorithm from scratch to implement the principles of the Naive Bayes Classifier using Python and standard data structures. 
Applied this custom classifier to predict the conditional probability of class labels within the Car Evaluation dataset obtained from the UCR Machine Learning Repository.
